# Quadcopter Project
-----------------------------------
## Introduction
------------------------------------
Objective is to design an agent to fly a quadcopter, and then train it using a reinforcement learning algorithm of your choice. 
This is part of the [Udacity](udacity.com) DeepLearing Nano Degree program.

## Files in the Project
--------------------------------------
> data.txt: Data to train the agent

> task.py: Define your task (environment) in this file.

> agents/: Folder containing reinforcement learning agents.

> agents/policy_search.py: A sample agent has been provided here.

> agents/agent.py: Develop your agent here.

> physics_sim.py: This file contains the simulator for the quadcopter. **DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.**

> rewards.txt: This is the output of total rewards collected by the trained agent over a 1000 episodes.


For this project, you will define your own task in `task.py`. Although we have provided a example task to get you started, you are encouraged to change it. 

You will also design a reinforcement learning agent in `agent.py` to complete your chosen task.

You will need a software installed to run and execute a *Jupyter Notebook*. If you do not have **Python** installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the **Anaconda distribution of Python**, which already has the above packages and more included.
